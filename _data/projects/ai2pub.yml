    Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a powerful and pervasive technology, influencing many aspects of our daily lives. 
    However, its rapid growth and integration into society raise complex questions and concerns. 
    Our team of scientists and communication experts are committed to improving public understanding of AI technologies, fostering a positive societal impact.
    Building on the foundations of our previous project, NewsOnAI, we will go beyond traditional communication channels such as workshops and media publications. 
    Our proactive engagement efforts will establish dynamic, two-way communication between scientists and the public, utilizing new formats like interactive exhibitions and theater performances. 
    Analyzing feedback from these initiatives will enable scientists to pursue research directions that effectively address societal concerns. Over time, we anticipate that our efforts will create a multiplying social impact, fostering informed public discourse and a deeper understanding of AI technologies.
